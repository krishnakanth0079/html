        <p><span>Srinivasa Ramanujan born 22 December 1887.</span> He was an Indian mathematician who lived during 
        the British Rule in India. Though he had almost no formal training in pure mathematics,
        he made substantial contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued 
        fractions, including solutions to mathematical problems then considered unsolvable. Ramanujan initially
        developed his own mathematical research in isolation:according to Hans Eysenck: "He tried to interest
        the leading professional mathematicians in his work, but failed for the most part. What he had to show 
        them was too novel, too unfamiliar, and additionally presented in unusual ways; they could not be bothered".
        Seeking mathematicians who could better understand his work,  <span>in 1913 he began a postal partnership with 
        the English mathematician G. H. Hardy at the University of Cambridge, England</span>. Recognizing Ramanujan's work 
        as extraordinary, Hardy arranged for him to travel to Cambridge. In his notes, Hardy commented that Ramanujan
        had produced groundbreaking new theorems, including some that "defeated me completely; I had never seen 
        anything in the least like them before", and some recently proven but highly advanced results.</p>
        <p>During his short life, Ramanujan independently compiled nearly 3,900 results (mostly identities and equations).
        Many were completely novel; his original and highly unconventional results, such as the Ramanujan prime, the Ramanujan 
        theta function, partition formulae and mock theta functions, have opened entire new areas of work and inspired a vast
        amount of further research. Nearly all his claims have now been proven correct.The Ramanujan Journal, a scientific 
        journal, was established to publish work in all areas of mathematics influenced by Ramanujan, and his 
        notebooks—containing summaries of his published and unpublished results—have been analysed and studied for decades
        since his death as a source of new mathematical ideas.<span> As late as 2012, researchers continued to discover that mere
        comments in his writings about "simple properties" and "similar outputs" </span>for certain findings were themselves
        profound and subtle number theory results that remained unsuspected until nearly a century after his death.
        He became one of the youngest Fellows of the Royal Society and only the second Indian member, and the first Indian
        to be elected a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. Of his original letters, Hardy stated that a single look was
        enough to show they could have been written only by a mathematician of the highest calibre, comparing Ramanujan 
        to mathematical geniuses such as Euler and Jacobi.</p>
    <div>
        <p>In 1919, ill health—now believed to have been hepatic amoebiasis(a complication from episodes of dysentery many years 
        previously)—compelled Ramanujan's return to India, where hedied in 1920 at the age of 32. His last letters to Hardy,
        written in January 1920, show that he was still continuing to produce new mathematical ideas and theorems. His "lost notebook", 
        containing discoveries from thelast year of his life, caused great excitement among mathematicians when it was rediscovered
        in 1976.A deeplyreligious Hindu, Ramanujan credited his substantial mathematical capacities to divinity, and said the 
        mathematical knowledge he displayed was revealed to him by his family goddess Namagiri Thayar.<span> He once said,
        "An equation for me has no meaning unless it expresses a thought of God.</span></p>
